# ðŸ“¦ Shoot The Box ðŸ”«

A simple 2D shooting game developed as a Mini-Project for the 'Python Programming' subject in Graduation year.

## Gameplay

- 1 Player game with PvE mechanics.
- Player uses the mouse as a gun in the game.
- The objective is to shoot the box target that appears on the screen.
- The game tracks hits and accuracy, displayed in the top left corner (e.g., "Hits: 0 Accuracy: 100%").
- The player controls a gun at the left of the screen, within a green circular area.
- Mouse motion controls the gun's movement, and any mouse button can be used to shoot.

## Controls

- **Mouse Motion**: Move the gun within the green circular area.
- **Left Mouse Button**: Shoot at the box target.

## Features

- **Hit Counter**: Tracks the number of successful hits on the box.
- **Accuracy Percentage**: Displays the player's shooting accuracy in real-time.
- **Simple Graphics**: Minimalistic 2D design with a green player area, a gun, and a box target.

## Development

- **Libraries**:  
    - `pygame` for graphics and event handling (based on typical Python game development practices).
- **Purpose**: Created as a learning project to demonstrate basic game development concepts like event handling, collision detection, and user interface updates.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game.
2. Use your mouse to move the gun within the green circular area.
3. Click any mouse button to shoot at the box target.
4. Aim to hit the box as many times as possible within the time limit.
5. Monitor your hits and accuracy in the top left corner.

## Future Improvements

- Code optimization ( Scoring, Refactoring & CleanUp) 
- Introduce moving targets or multiple boxes for increased difficulty.
- Implement a scoring system with bonuses for consecutive hits.

## Installation

1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Create virtual environment & install `pygame`.
3. Run the main script (e.g., `python main.py`).
